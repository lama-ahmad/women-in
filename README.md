# women-in
A repository of academic and creative resources specifically focused on non-white-male contributions. This repository comes out of a possible need for centralized resources when it comes to teaching (classes/workshops/informal), and assigning readings or showing examples from non-white-males.

Ideally, this would not be a repository exclusively **about gender**, but about anything **from the perspective of a non-white-male** <3

Thoughts, questions, remarks:
- can be sent to pierre.depaz@nyu.edu
- be flagged as an issue
- have a pull request opened

They are more than welcome, especially regarding the organization of content.
