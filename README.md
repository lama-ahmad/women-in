# women-in
A repository of academic and creative resources specifically focused on non-male contributions. This repository comes out of a possible need for centralized resources when it comes to teaching (classes/workshops/informal), and assigning readings or showing examples from non-males.

Thoughts, questions, remarks:
- can be sent to pierre.depaz@nyu.edu
- be flagged as an issue
- have a pull request opened

They are more than welcome, especially regarding the organization of content.
